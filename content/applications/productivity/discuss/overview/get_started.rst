Get started with discuss
========================

Discuss allows you to bring all of a company’s communication together through messages, notes, and
chat. Share information, projects, files, prioritize tasks, and stay connected with colleagues and
partners throughout applications. Forge better relationships, increase productivity and transparency
by promoting a convenient way of communicating.

Choose notifications preference
===============================

Access your *preferences* by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings app --> Users --> User -->
Preferences tab`. Then choose either :guilabel:`Handle by Emails` or :guilabel:`Handle in Odoo` for
how the user's notifications should be handled.

By default, the field is set as :guilabel:`Handle by Emails`. Every time a message is sent; or a
note is sent where there is an '@' mention; or when a notification is sent on a record that the
user's follows, a email message will be sent via the email function in Odoo.

By choosing :guilabel:`Handle in Odoo`, the above notifications are shown in the *Dicuss* app's
:guilabel:`Inbox`. Messages can then be :guilabel:`Marked as Todo`, :guilabel:`Replied`,
:guilabel:`Marked as Read` or responded with an :guilabel:`emoji`.

The messages tagged as :guilabel:`Mark as Todo` are also shown in :guilabel:`Starred`, while the
ones :guilabel:`Marked as Read` are moved to :guilabel:`History`.

Start chatting
==============

The first time a user logs in their account, OdooBot sends a message asking for permission to
receive desktop notifications to chats. If accepted, the user will receive push notifications for
the messages they receive despite where the user is in Odoo.

You can also create :doc:`public and private channels <team_communication>`.

Mentions in the chat and on the chatter
---------------------------------------

To mention a user within a chat or the chatter type *@user-name*; to refer to a channel, type
*#channel-name*. A notification is sent to the user mentioned either to the *Inbox* or through an
email, depending on the settings.

.. tip::
   When a user is mentioned, the search list (list of names) suggests values first based on the
   task’s followers, and secondly on *Employees*. If the record being searched does not match with
   either a follower or employee, the scope of the search becomes all partners.

User status
-----------

It is helpful to see what colleagues are up to and how quickly they can respond to messages by
checking their *status*. The status is shown on the left side of a contact’s names on Discuss’
sidebar and on the *Messaging menu*.

- Green = online
- Orange = away
- White = offline
- Airplane = out of the office
