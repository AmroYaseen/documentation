EU intra-community distance selling
===================================

EU intra-community distance selling involves the cross-border trade of goods and services from
vendors registered for VAT purposes to individuals (B2C) located in a European Union member state.
The transaction is conducted remotely, typically through online platforms, mail orders, telephone,
or other means of communication.

EU intra-community distance selling is subject to specific VAT rules and regulations. The vendor
must charge VAT per the VAT rate applicable in the buyer's country.

.. note::
   This remains applicable even if the vendor is located outside of the European Union.

One-Stop Shop (OSS)
===================

The :abbr:`OSS (One-Stop Shop)` system introduced by the European Union simplifies VAT collection
for **cross-border** sales of goods and services. It primarily applies to business-to-consumer
**(B2C)** cases. With the OSS, businesses can register for VAT in their home country and use a
single online portal to handle VAT obligations for their sales within the EU. There are **two
primary schemes**: the **Union OSS** scheme for cross-border services and the **Import OSS** scheme
for goods valued at or below â‚¬150.

Reports
-------

To generate **OSS sales** or **OSS imports** reports and submit them onto the OSS portal, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`, click :guilabel:`Tax Report: Global
Summary`, and select either :guilabel:`OSS Sales` or :guilabel:`OSS Imports`. Once selected, click
on :guilabel:`PDF`, :guilabel:`XLSX`, or :guilabel:`XML` in the top-left corner. This generates the
currently-opened report in the selected format. Once generated, log into the platform of your
competent federal authority to submit it onto the OSS portal.
